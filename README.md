* I am not liable for any losses that could occur through the use of my program. I have tested it to the best of my abilities but as a highschool student , i donot posses the firmware to test multiple systems.

* Data loss is a very real possiblity so i recommend backing up before letting my program sort your photos

* I dont know how to make my program handle spaces in file paths. Feel free to open up a pull request if you know how to implement this
